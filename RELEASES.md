* shmem: enforce provider ID in range `[1, 255]`
* wattsup-libftdi: compilation fails with clang when `-Werror` option is used

## [v0.4.0] - 2021-05-12

### Added

* ibmpowernv-power: new implementation for IBM PowerNV systems (targeted for OLCF Summit)

  * Export CMake targets during install
* rapl: document Linux kernel changes/differences in README
* raplcap-msr: update minimum dependency version to 0.5.0
* wattsup-libftdi [#47]: prefer `ftdi_tcioflush` if available (`ftdi_usb_purge_buffers` deprecated in libftdi 1.5)
* energymon-idle-power: now accepts idle time in fractional seconds

### Fixed

* Valid 0 return values from fread functions mistaken for errors when errno is already set
* cray-pm: building as default libraries used wrong macro, causing build failures
* osp: some cumulative energy unaccounted for during overflow detection (precision loss)
* raplcap-msr: Requires.private field in pkg-config file should specify the minimum version for raplcap-msr dependency
* wattsup-libftdi: Description field in pkg-config file was empty
* energymon-power-poller: incorrect Pmin summary output when number of samples is 0


## [v0.3.1] - 2020-10-27

### Fixed

* rapl [#46]: Check that top-level zones are actually package (not psys) zones
* rapl: Set errno when when no zones are found during init


## [v0.3.0] - 2020-03-10

### Added

* raplcap-msr: New implementation using libraplcap-msr (more features than `msr` and `rapl` implementations)
* utils [#44]: Build utilities for all implementations, not just energymon-default
* test: Build tests for all implementations, not just energymon-default

### Changed

* man pages: More pedantic formatting
* RELEASES: Reformat file

### Fixed

* cmake [#14]: Print useful CMake error when bad ENERGYMON_BUILD_DEFAULT value is set
* rapl: Powercap directory paths use lower case hex values, not decimal values
* zcu102: Potential memory leak in 'get_sensor_directories' under failure conditions


## [v0.2.4] - 2018-06-01

### Changed

* WattsUp implementations:
  * Wait up to 5 seconds for a good data packet (or fail) before completing initialization
  * Purge data buffers during initialization
  * Poll device at shorter intervals to increase energy value accuracy
  * Better handling of incomplete data packets
* osp-polling: Allow polling thread to be interrupted during sleep when finish is requested
* energymon-power-poller: Account for true elapsed time to produce more accurate power values

### Fixed

* wattsup-libftdi, wattsup-libusb: Fix empty reads by always setting baud rate and serial line properties
* wattsup-dev: Use pselect to avoid timer expired errors
* odroid, odroid-ioctl, osp-polling, zcu102: Minor correction to polling delay interval
* msr: Possible (but unlikely) precision computation bug
